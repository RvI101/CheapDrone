# CheapDrone
Telegram bot written using the python telepot wrapper to get the cheapest deals on video game titles by utilising the CheapShark API

Bot Username : @CheapSharkBot
Inline querying the bot with a string will give you a list of 8 titles that are closest matching. Selecting any will give you cheapest price it is currently available for and on which store.
This uses the CheapShark API to both search for the titles and do the deal lookup.
